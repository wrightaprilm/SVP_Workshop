Resources
=============

##Python

###Web 

[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/)

Software Carpentry is an organization dedicated to teaching computer science topics to a non-computer science audience. They have many documents and lectures on their website that are excellent for beginning and intermediate learners.

[Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/) 

Code academy is an excellent resource for beginning programming. It has an in-browser python interpreter to give instant feedback on the work you've done. It's pretty nifty.

[Learn Python](http://www.learnpython.org/)

Another web-based interpreter for practice.

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/)

Rosalind is an introduction to bioinformatics platform. It tends to focus on DNA-based analyses, but the underlying concepts are important for all Pythonistas to know.

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

Regarded by many as the definitive source for Python beginners. Very nice written explanations of basic and intermediate Python concepts.

###Books

[Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do)

Using the Pandas library we used today, this book breaks down data input, output and processing in a very practical way.

[Practical Computing for Biologists] (http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Computing-Biologists-Steven-Haddock/dp/0878933913)

Not really python, but this book contains a lot of general and quite useful advise about builing reproducible and useful scripts.

##Git

[GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)

The people at GitHub have put a lot of effort into making git accessible. Their documentation is great.

[Scott Chacon](http://git-scm.com/book)

Scott has created a lot of really lovely online materials walking through the use of git. Very cool site.

[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-basics)

The Atlassian development also has a really nice overview of git usage.

##Shell

[Explain Shell](http://explainshell.com/)

ExplainShell gives plain English explanations of what shell commands are doing. Very nice for beginners.
